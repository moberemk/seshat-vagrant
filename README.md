seshat-vagrant
==============

This is the Vagrant environment used for the Seshat tracker system; the Vagrantfile defines the base specifications for a server to work, but the most important component to consider here is found in the `setup.sh` as that's the core of the provisioning process, setting up the necessary services for the application to run.
